Hi, I am Changqian Wang! Currently, I am a second-year master's student at Anhui University, under the guidance of Associate Professor [Haiping Ma](https://wky.ahu.edu.cn/2023/0926/c13481a316092/page.htm). My research interests are data mining and intelligent education, including cognitive diagnosis and computerized adaptive testing. I prefer to seek PhD opportunity after my Master study.

**1.Enhancing Cognitive Diagnosis using Un-interacted Exercises: A Collaboration-aware Mixed Sampling Approach (AAAI2024)**
------

Cognitive diagnosis is a crucial task in intelligent education, aiming to diagnose students' proficiency in specific knowledge concepts through their answer records. Existing efforts are primarily based on modeling with actual student historical response data, as interactive exercises offer maximum diagnostic value. However, extracting information from non-interactive exercises and designing potential answer labels for students pose significant challenges. To address these challenges, we innovatively proposed the Collaborative Perception Mixed Exercise Sampling (CMES) framework. CMES not only extracts more diagnostically valuable information from a vast pool of non-interactive exercises but also designs potential answer labels for students on such exercises. Specifically, to enhance sampling quality and efficiency, we exclude exercises related to knowledge concepts that students have already interacted with and those with potentially similar information to interacted concepts. We cluster students based on their answering abilities and collaborative relationships, sampling exercises from sets interacted with by students from other clusters. Given the rich diagnostic information in interactive exercises and the diverse information inherent in non-interactive exercises, we employ a blending technique to fuse the information of sampled exercises with that of interactive exercises, obtaining more information-rich samples. Finally, we design an unfed module based on ranking learning to assign potential answer labels to the fused exercises.
