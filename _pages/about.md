Hi, I am Changqian Wang! Currently, I am a second-year master's student at Anhui University, under the guidance of Associate Professor [Haiping Ma](https://wky.ahu.edu.cn/2023/0926/c13481a316092/page.htm). My research interests are data mining and intelligent education, including cognitive diagnosis and computerized adaptive testing. I prefer to seek PhD opportunity after my Master study.
